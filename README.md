Amazon Web Scraper
File: Amazon_Web_Scraper.ipynb

This project demonstrates web scraping techniques using Python. The notebook includes:

Scraping product data from Amazon India.
Utilizing BeautifulSoup for HTML parsing.
Storing scraped data into CSV files for further analysis.
Heart Disease Prediction Model
File: HeartDiseaseModel.ipynb

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict heart disease. The notebook includes:

Data preprocessing and exploration.
Feature engineering and selection.
Building and evaluating a classification model using various algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM).
Model performance metrics and evaluation.
Stock Predictor for India
File: StockPredictorIndia.ipynb

This project involves building a predictive model for stock prices. The notebook includes:

Fetching historical stock data from online sources.
Time series analysis and forecasting.
Building and evaluating predictive models using algorithms such as ARIMA, LSTM, and Prophet.
Visualization of stock price predictions.
Getting Started
To get started with these projects, clone the repository to your local machine:

sh
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/python-ML-projects.git
cd python-ML-projects
Dependencies
Each project has its own set of dependencies. It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage these dependencies. The main dependencies across projects include:

Python 3.7+
Jupyter Notebook
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
BeautifulSoup4
Requests
Matplotlib
Seaborn
TensorFlow (for LSTM model)
Install the dependencies using pip:

sh
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Note: Ensure to check each notebook for additional specific dependencies.

Usage
To run any of the notebooks:

Open the terminal or Anaconda Prompt.
Navigate to the project directory.
Launch Jupyter Notebook:
sh
Copy code
jupyter notebook
Open the desired .ipynb file and run the cells.
